#Install Instructions
This project is currently in progess and will require substantial work for the user to run.

To run this project, first create a Ubunutu 24.04 virtual machine or install WSL. There are instructions for installing a virtual machine at `https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials/blob/master/vm-ubuntu-24.04/README-create-vm-using-iso-installer.md.`

Next, follow the instructions at `https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials/blob/master/vm-ubuntu-24.04/README.md` to clone the P4 tutorials repo. This repo contains necessary tools for using P4 digests.

Run git clone `https://github.com/JinLabIIT/P4-Digests/.`

As this repo is updated, next steps will be added. Currently, you will need to send Grace a slack message for further instructions.
